<h1>Ford</h1>
America loves its pick-up trucks, so much so that the nation bought 198,338
<a href="https://www.opentutorials.org/course/3086/18319">Ford</a> F-Seriesâ€™ in 2020 Q4 alone. While this may be less than the 233,952
sold in 2019 Q4, it does mean that the Ford F-Series is still the best-selling
passenger vehicle in the United States.

<strong><h3>Furniture</h3></strong>
<p>At <strong><u>anko</u></strong>,</p>
you’ll find thousands of vintage chairs,
tables, storage pieces,<br>and more that were produced from the dawn of
the industrial revolution,<br>right on through to today—with an emphasis on
the ever-popular,<br>beyond timeless works of midcentury modernism.
Every object tells a story.
<br>Make one yours today.
<br><br><br><br>
<strong><h3>Fabric</h3></strong>
<p></p>Crafted from fabrics selected
<br>for their quality and designed for everyday wear,
<br>the wardrobe is eminently modular—the supple silhouettes
<br>and soft color palette allow anko outfits to be restyled
<br>and accented over time. Pieces from different collections
<br>and seasons can be paired effortlessly while maintaining the space
<br>floating around the body as it moves.
<br>Some elements are borrowed from traditional Asian clothing:
<br>deep pockets, sleek design, and the allegory of the perfectly proportioned
<br>home as a protective shelter for a peaceful, self-assured life.
<br>Workwear and military garb lend practicality and sturdy finishing
<br>to the pieces in the wardrobe.
<br><br><br>
<strong><h3>Flowers</h3></strong>
<p></p>Since we are a locally owned anko flower shop,
<br>every floral order we receive delights us.
<br>We take so much pride in making every floral design
<br>that goes out of our doors seasonally custom with special attention
<br>to every detail.... it is our attention to detail
<br>and superior fresh product, extreme convenience
<br>and happy customer service that has made anko Flowershop
<br>a household name in seoul.
<br><br>
<p>Based in Seoul, South Korea.
<br>Founded in 2021.</p>

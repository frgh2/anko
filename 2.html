<strong><h3>Fabric</h3></strong>
<p></p>Crafted from fabrics selected
<br>for their quality and designed for everyday wear,
<br>the wardrobe is eminently modularâ€”the supple silhouettes
<br>and soft color palette allow anko outfits to be restyled
<br>and accented over time. Pieces from different collections
<br>and seasons can be paired effortlessly while maintaining the space
<br>floating around the body as it moves.
<br>Some elements are borrowed from traditional Asian clothing:
<br>deep pockets, sleek design, and the allegory of the perfectly proportioned
<br>home as a protective shelter for a peaceful, self-assured life.
<br>Workwear and military garb lend practicality and sturdy finishing
<br>to the pieces in the wardrobe.
